This is a new way to denominate money using negative numbers. 

The name of the imaginary currency is snacklecoins because it makes me laugh



This is how it works



1 USD (or etc.) equals 1 snacklecoin.

1000000 (1 million USD) = 0 snacklecoins.

2000000 (2 million USD) = -1 snacklecoin.



If you have 0 USD, you actually have 1000000 snacklecoins. You already do!

between 0 and 1, you will have something between 1000000 and 1 snacklecoins (the first 1 million is easy!).



I have built a small calculator. calculator.rb

here's a number line:

USD . . . . . . . . . . 2000000 . . . . 1000000 . . . . . 1 .  . . . (.50) (50 cents) . . . . . . . 0

Snacklecoins . . . . . . -1 . . . . . . . 0 . . . . . . .  1 . . . . 500000  . . . . . . . . . . 1000000

Each subsequent 1 million will add -1.
